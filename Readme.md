# [Cora Project]

## This project focuses on graph-based machine learning using the Cora citation network dataset. It leverages PyTorch Geometric to implement, train, and evaluate graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification tasks. The Cora dataset consists of scientific publications as nodes and citation relationships as edges, categorized into multiple research topics. The primary goal is to explore GNN architectures like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to improve classification accuracy and understand graph-structured data.
