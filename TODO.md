- files to create (outputs are tables, use seeding):
  - Focal vs weighted sampler vs normal sampling comparison across models
  - edge dropout and node dropout comparison across models
  - node2vec comparison across models

- Based on the above tables, create the best-model in each model class
- train and save
- compare using F1-score and Confusion matrices
- create an interface to the models (loaded from a file)
