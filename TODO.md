Comparisons:
- Choose best model from below (grid-search OR random search)
  - Different models and their hyper-parameters
  - node2vec and without n2v
  - regularization and scheduler

- Tune it via the following:
  - Class imbalance (Focal loss; weighted sampler; normal sampling)
  - Data augmentation (Edge dropout, node dropout)
